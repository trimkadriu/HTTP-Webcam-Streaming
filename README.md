# WebCam Stream v1.0 #

WebCam Stream through HTTP Protocol using Ajax Polling technique

**TODO's left:**

* Generate Desktop app from Server with predefined variables
* FIX bug when cleaning while streaming, takes too much time therefore we loose live stream images
* Use lower cam resolution for better and faster streaming
* Initialize and update (on time interval) variables on client side from server
* Make most of the config parameters dynamic, defined by web app (php)
* Add user and cam client management
* Add security layer by using different means of logins
* Add nice PHP setup script that will generate everything and will make the app user friendly
